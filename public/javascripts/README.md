## Useful Files
- app.js is the 'main' module. It handles the setup (what to load, what to do after the load), the camera, the motion, the car, and the lighting. Needs a good amount of cleanup.
- laneEditor.js abstracts away everything relevant to the laneEditing aspect of driverseat. It handles mouse events, lane types, colors etc.



## Almost Certainly not useful
- draggable.js is code to make the image canvas draggable. I would want to move this out of this folder someday.
